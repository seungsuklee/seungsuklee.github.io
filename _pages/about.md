======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University. 
I work with [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](https://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/) on two research projects: "Explaining sound change through mapping the distribution of phonetic biases and automatic speech analysis" (Morgan) and "Towards a robust model of individual differences in context effects in speech perception" (Meghan). 

My research investigates how categorical linguistic structure is learned from gradient acoustic input. I focus on the interaction between segmental realization and prosodic structure, and on how learners infer this interdependency from the speech signal. My work integrates phonological theory, speech perception, and quantitative modeling.
