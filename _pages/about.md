Seung Suk (Josh) Lee
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University. 
I work with [Morgan Sonderegger](https://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/) and [Meghan Clayards](https://speechlearning.lab.mcgill.ca/). 

My research investigates how categorical linguistic structure is learned from gradient acoustic input. I focus on the interaction between segmental realization and prosodic structure, and on how learners infer this interdependency from the speech signal. My work integrates phonological theory, speech perception, and quantitative modeling.
